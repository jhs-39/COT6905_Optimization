## Course Description

This directed study investigates the advanced mathematical and optimization foundations required for training and deploying large-scale foundational AI models. Topics include:

- Matrix theory for understanding and improving optimization algorithms (vector spaces, ranks, block operations, decompositions)
- Tensor factorization techniques relevant to modern architectures
- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and adaptive optimizers
- Stability of large-scale training (conditioning, vanishing/exploding gradients)
- Second-order optimization methods (natural gradient, quasi-Newton)
- Model compression strategies: quantization, pruning, distillation, low-rank approximations
- Scaling laws, training dynamics, and hardware-aware optimization
- Evaluation metrics beyond accuracy: FLOPs, latency, memory footprint, energy cost

Students will develop the mathematical and computational background to contribute to state-of-the-art research in model compression and efficient large-scale AI.

## Topics Covered

- Matrix theory foundations for deep learning
- Block matrix multiplications and tensor factorization
- Stochastic gradient descent and adaptive optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, etc.)
- Numerical stability in optimization: conditioning, exploding/vanishing gradients, preconditioning
- Second-order optimization algorithms: natural gradient, quasi-Newton, Fisher-based methods
- Probabilistic and information-theoretic tools: entropy, KL divergence, variational inference
- Model compression: quantization, structured/unstructured pruning, knowledge distillation
- Hardware-aware optimization: mixed-precision training, quantization-aware training
- Scaling laws and training dynamics of large AI models
- Evaluation metrics for efficiency: FLOPs, throughput, latency, memory footprint, and accuracy trade-offs

## Course Work

Students are expected to create an **online e-Book** synthesizing the material, with simplified explanations, references to videos, and interactive examples. Computational notebooks should be organized in a **public GitHub repository** for reproducibility.

## Expected Outcomes

After this course, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate mastery of matrix theory applied to deep learning
- Explain modern model compression techniques from a matrix theory perspective
- Understand advanced optimization algorithms, including second-order methods
- Apply probabilistic and information-theoretic concepts to optimization and compression
- Produce professional-quality documentation and computational notebooks

## Grading

- **100%** – Final e-Book report and GitHub deliverables

## Exams

- There are no exams; grades are based solely on reports and supplemental deliverables.

## Academic Conduct

Students are expected to comply with the **Student Code of Academic Conduct** regarding plagiarism and misconduct. More information: [Dean of Students – Academic Conduct](https://uwf.edu/deanofstudents)
