    "## Summary\n",
    "This lecture introduces linear algebra through the lens of solving systems of equations. We can view matrices two ways, either through the \"row picture\" (geometric intersection of lines/planes defined by each row-equation) and the \"column picture\" (linear combinations of vectors corresponding to each column).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "### Row Picture\n",
    "Each row from the matrix form represents a line (in 2D) or plane (in 3D). Solutions occur at the intersections of these structures.\n",
    "Below is an interactive visualization of the row picture for a 2x2 system of equations (ax + by = c and dx + ey = f). Launch a live code session (Rocket Icon->Live Code) and change the coefficients to observe how the lines and their intersection point (solution) change!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Question for understanding: will you be able to get a solution [X, Y] for **any point** in the plane, if the given rows are parallel lines? Hint: parallel lines don't intersect!"

    "This lecture introduces LU factorization, a method to decompose a matrix into simpler triangular forms, along with the inverse of matrix products and permutation matrices. These concepts streamline solving linear systems and enhance our understanding of matrix operations You’ll learn why LU factorization is efficient, how permutations handle row swaps, and get hands-on with an interactive tool to explore these ideas.\n",

    "### Inverse of Matrix Products\n",
    "\n",
    "For two invertible matrices $A$ and $B$, the inverse of their product $AB$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This holds because:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(AB)(B^{-1} A^{-1}) = A (B B^{-1}) A^{-1} = A I A^{-1} = I\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of inverses reverses, which is crucial when rearranging matrix equations.\n",
    "Additionally, if $A$ is invertible, the inverse of its transpose is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties help us manipulate matrix equations, especially in LU factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LU Factorization: Decomposing Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "LU factorization breaks a square matrix $A$ into:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L$: A lower triangular matrix with 1s on the diagonal and zeros above.\n",
    "\n",
    "$U$: An upper triangular matrix with zeros below the diagonal; our row-reduced matrix we found in the last lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \n",
    "A = LU \n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for solving systems $Ax = b$. Gaussian elimination transforms $A$ into an upper triangular $U$ using elimination matrices $E_{ij}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \n",
    "E_{32} E_{31} E_{21} A = U \n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $E_{ij}$ eliminates an entry in row $i$, column $j$ below the pivot by subtracting a multiple of row $j$. To express $A$, we rearrange:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \n",
    "A = (E_{32} E_{31} E_{21})^{-1} U \n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the inverse of products rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(E_{32} E_{31} E_{21})^{-1} = E_{21}^{-1} E_{31}^{-1} E_{32}^{-1}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This product of inverse elimination matrices forms $L$. If $E_{ij}$ subtracts $c \\cdot \\text{row } j$ from row $i$ (i.e., $E_{ij} = I - c e_i e_j^T$ ), its inverse $E_{ij}^{-1}$ adds $c$, placing $c$ in $L$’s $(i,j)$ position below the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use LU Factorization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency:** Solving $Ax = b$ via Gaussian elimination takes $\\frac{1}{3}n^3$ operations for an $n \\times n$ matrix (each of $n$ pivots requires $O(n^2)$ work). With LU factorization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute $L$ and $U$ once $( \\frac{1}{3}n^3 )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve $Ly = b$ (forward substitution) and $Ux = y$ (backward substitution), each in $\\frac{1}{2}n^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $k$ different $b$ vectors, total cost is $\\frac{1}{3}n^3 + k n^2 $, versus $k \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}n^3$ without LU. This is a huge win for multiple solves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplicity:** $L$ collects the multipliers from elimination, making the process systematic. If no row swaps occur, $L$’s subdiagonal entries are exactly these multipliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility:** LU factorization works for any invertible matrix (with pivoting, if needed), simplifying computations like inverses or determinants.\n",
